Install Apache using Ansible

This play book will do:


1: install apache ( httpd daemon )
2: inventory is host which is probably centos-box
3: install apache using sudo on remote system
4: and sudo user is root which will perform the task
5: Install httpd
6: Make sure service httpd is running ( start httpd daemon )
7: enable on boot ( it will do similar to this : chkconfig httpd on ( on 2,3,4,5 runlevels)

Thats all
